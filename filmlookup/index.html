        <a href="#" class="movie-link" data-title="Zero Dark Thirty" data-review="Very good example of: <i>A team must grind its way through a process to the bitter end.</i> Depicts the assassination of Osama bin Laden."><i>Zero Dark Thirty</i> (2012)</a><br>
        <a href="#" class="movie-link" data-title="Nosferatu" data-review="It's hard to say if Eggers pushed the needle on <i>Nosferatu</i> for me. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd's portrayal of Orlok is amazing, though, leaving tons of ambiguity as to whether this creature is an emotionally complex being or just an adaptable blood-sucking monkey. The time commitment is far too great for such an orthodox presentation of such an old story, imo, but there is some food for thought and it's a bit of an event, no?"><i>Nosferatu</i> (2024)</a><br>
        <a href="#" class="movie-link" data-title="Agatha and the Truth of Murder" data-review="Focusing on a very mysterious chunk of time in the real life of Agatha Christie. This movie gives you a conversation between Christie and Conan Doyle. It rules, even if it's not amazing cinema."><i>Agatha and the Truth of Murder</i> (2018)</a><br>
        <a href="#" class="movie-link" data-title="Field of Dreams" data-review="The concept has strengthened with age: You built a baseball diamond and now your life is about attracting the ghosts of baseball players. Costner is fairly restrained, but the camera is <i>all over this man.</i>"><i>Field of Dreams</i> (1989)</a><br>
        <a href="#" class="movie-link" data-title="Escape from New York" data-review="Iconic protagonist, neat performances, <i>AMAZING</i> soundtrack... But there aren't many reasons to watch it otherwise. Not to backseat write the movie but it would have benefited from like a chess tournament using human pieces or something like that."><i>Escape from New York</i> (1981)</a>
