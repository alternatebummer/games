    title: "What You Do",
    content: `Now discern: what will you do<br>
Choice and hardship make a pair<br>
And lo, you walk on tangled roots<br>
A path it laid for cunning boots<br>
And laces tied, yet feet are bare<br>
In retrospect 'tis hard to prove<br>
If it'wer choice that put you there<br><br>
Watchyou now, it's always new<br>
Tho'twer not choice what put you there<br>
Boots thee did intend to lose<br>
Thee, the stuff of mother goose<br>
And were it path or rocking chair<br>
By thread so brown methink it blue<br>
And tempt thee down from staying there<br><br>
Why 'tis one way, never two<br>
No, I swore I'd never care<br>
Tho dissipate and naught thru act<br>
The stress is loost upon the fact<br>
And naught was mine that gave it voice<br>
Sum of dreams and cataracte'd heart<br>
Withnaught recourse but to start<br>
How it'wer has brought me to<br>
With watchful eye for what you do`

  poem2: {
    title: "Hollow Sound",
    content: `before the meltdown runs below<br>
the browning of the leaves<br>
we saw black horses passing slow<br>
behind the alder trees<br><br>
until the frozen thought returns<br>
I buck the deadfall down<br>
and burn whatever’s green, and burn<br>
what makes a hollow sound`

  poem3: {
    title: "Civilization",
    content: `bullfrogs are croaking beneath<br>
leaves of ivy; each with their own<br>
precise modulation<br><br>
ever reshaping amphibian<br>
histories; each with its own<br>
fatigued deformation<br><br>
maybe we're seeking a natural<br>
tapestry; each with our own<br>
distressed obligation<br><br>
slowly approaching a bullfrog's<br>
philosophy; ever we croak<br>
a routine resignation<br><br>
then in the morning, a pondwater<br>
hobby; then in the gloam<br>
a new civilization`
  },
  poem4: {
    title: "The Weather",
    content: `I’m unsurpassed<br>
in hyperlast<br>
like hot wind<br>
lifts a feather<br><br>
and from the sky<br>
I magnify<br>
or see it<br>
all together<br><br>
like milipedes<br>
the trenches lead<br>
to fields of<br>
purple heather<br><br>
too scared to rain<br>
I grasp at morning mist<br>
and curse the weather`

  poem5: {
    title: "What’s Common",
    content: `we’re not all of us lovers tonight<br>
but lovers must<br>
still have their time<br><br>
and to love and escape<br>
is a lover-bird’s right<br>
while lovers who hunt<br>
will be easy to find<br>
as the hunters who love<br>
hunt at night<br><br>
there are free-winged birds<br>
in the heights<br>
those martlets subsist<br>
on a powerful gust<br>
while birds sworn to earth<br>
make a study of doubt<br>
the dodo enshrining their earthly trust<br>
as the hunters who bird<br>
are about<br><br>
the hunter, herself,<br>
must a friend to me be<br>
and the watcher’s<br>
her sworn mortal foe<br>
watchful hunters<br>
must fire so cautiously<br>
while the watchers who free<br>
are the kindest<br>
to know<br><br>
“concomitantly,” “interchangeable”<br>
what does it mean to be “free”<br>
perhaps that confusion serves<br>
some kind of good<br>
the free-watcher’s words<br>
are not well understood<br>
as when told<br>
without being believed`

  poem6: {
    title: "Wont You Let Me In",
    content: `held between his fingers<br>
hide me in his grin<br>
I am just a mote of dust<br>
belaboured by the wind<br><br>
salt and water lingers<br>
sorrow sings again<br>
johnny's tear is falling near<br>
oh won't he let me in<br><br>
call the omen bringers<br>
murmuring within<br>
johnny brings the blackest wings<br>
oh I shall be his friend<br><br>
dance among the strangers<br>
sounds of mandolin<br>
johnny cries through his goodbyes<br>
oh now may I begin<br><br>
bluebird on his shoulder<br>
balanced on a pin<br>
johnny learns, for what it's worth<br>
oh shall we share his skin<br><br>
bears are getting bolder<br>
circling and thin<br>
johnny`

  poem7: {
    title: "Soft Green Landing",
    content: `a floodplain high<br>
in the heat of july<br>
mix me a mortar of<br>
gypsum and lime<br><br>
I am alive, still quite alive<br>
with enough green hats, I hope, to thrive<br>
many things, many things have yet to go<br><br>
ridgeline and grassland<br>
for decades they tried<br>
towns over lakes built<br>
on whiskey and wine<br><br>
many things, many things have yet to go<br>
and some yet to arrive<br>
I am Lazarus, come from the dead<br>
a light green hat atop my head<br><br>
north five and oh<br>
on the forestry line<br>
east one and sixteen<br>
we meet on the slide<br><br>
a light green, light green hat<br>
a pair of spectacles ajar<br>
many things have yet to go<br>
and I am still alive<br>
scuttling across the floors<br>
and scuttling a little more`

  poem8: {
    title: "We Know",
    content: `there’s a wise one waiting<br>
at the end of the station<br>
there’s a poem waiting<br>
at the end of the book<br>
there is something inside us speaking<br>
over what’s spoken<br><br>
there’s an urge gestating<br>
on the frontal lobe<br>
there’s a question dangling<br>
from the pocket of your coat<br>
ask it quick before it falls landing<br>
irreparably broken<br><br>
there’s an atom of silence<br>
we enter that’s hidden<br>
each of us born<br>
from an internal sun<br>
buried deep within crystallized years<br>
a self made from water<br>
frozen<br><br>
something just wants it<br>
all to be ending<br>
a hungry horizon is <br>
biding its time<br>
compelled we migrate<br>
goose-like ‘tward it<br><br>
somewhere the cave dwelling<br>
hermit is singing<br>
off canyon walls<br>
above basalt and snow<br>
her song sounding different<br>
to each one who listens<br>
calling each one of them home`

  poem9: {
    title: "With Little Friends",
    content: `winter chilled this ball of wax;<br>
what took the fire<br>
but left the warmth?<br>
why do I hold it like a friend?<br>
and wrestle with its thought,<br>
with a pond's thought, the<br>
thought of bamboo?<br>
the unveiled world has<br>
burned anew, and etching<br>
with its emberline: a mask,<br>
a path, a place to<br>
scavenge through<br><br>
warmth in snow is passed<br>
around; a looping thought<br>
I keep alive in fluid optics;<br>
pedestrian with woven bag;<br>
gelidus crust and viscid ground;<br>
the cloven world I cull and wander<br><br>
emberline and orange dawn,<br>
they gesture like a friend, and leave;<br>
their mind in mine, like a drink<br>
that leaves one warm with questions;<br>
tightly held, like a fist<br>
that forms a ball of wax<br>
I am blessed with little friends,<br>
gaslit by their clear ignition;<br>
finding bones on quiet branches,<br>
like each moment had a palm<br>
that agnized soggy aggregate<br>
and twirl'd the steam into a song;<br>
the whistle of a locomotive;<br>
poems howling from a dog;<br>
weaving thoughts like<br>
autumn grasses<br>
into something rare and strong`

  poem10: {
    title: "Way of the Dodo",
    content: `I move slow, for I’m alone<br>
in the shade of the dodo tree<br><br>
with nothing here to pull at me<br>
but all the leaves and bones I keep<br><br>
it matters not about my wings<br>
my legs will carry me<br><br>
and when I’m through, these tracks of mine<br>
will take me home before they cease`
