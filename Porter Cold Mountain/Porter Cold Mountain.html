            <p>I wish it were so that I write under better, calmer circumstances, or at least with happier news. Unfortunately, comms and logistics are still in disarray after the raid. DO NOT hike supplies or personnel to Waterfall camp for the time being, as the site is under state surveillance and most of us have fallen back to a location known only to us. With regard to food, we have made due.</p>
            <p>We will send a porter along with this letter. Please provide her with a replacement geolocator and any updates you deem critical. We will notify you once we are online.</p>
            <p>Regards,</p>

The state has become wildly authoritarian, using ecological conservation as a reason for displacing people left behind by the collapsing economy. As a result, the human denizens of Cold Mountain have banded together to protect their way of life, setting up blockades to keep out any unwanted visitors...</p>`,
