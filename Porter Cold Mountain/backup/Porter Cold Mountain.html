		<p>I wish it were so that I write under better, calmer circumstances, or at least with happier news. Unfortunately, comms and logistics are still in disarray 		after the raid. DO NOT hike supplies or personnel to Waterfall camp for the time being, as the site is under state surveillance and most of us have fallen 		back to a location known only to us. With regard to food, we have made due.</p>
        	<p>We will send a porter along with this letter. Please provide her with a replacement geolocator and any updates you deem critical. We will notify you once 		we are online.</p>
